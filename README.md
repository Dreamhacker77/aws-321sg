Solution Architecture reverse engineering AWS Security Groups withÂ Python
As a solution architect in the cloud, one of the key areas of focus is security. In AWS, security groups are an essential component of securing your environment. However, managing security groups can be a tedious and time-consuming task, especially when it comes to auditing the inbound rules for multiple EC2 instances.

To streamline this process, I wrote a Python script that leverages the AWS CLI to retrieve the inbound rules for EC2 instances and export the results to a CSV file. This solution saves time and effort and makes auditing security groups much easier.
Here's how the script works:

The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including the AWS CLI and the CSV library.
Next, the script uses the AWS CLI to retrieve the security group information for all EC2 instances. This information is stored in a JSON format.
The JSON data is then processed and organized into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a security group.
The list of dictionaries is then written to a CSV file, which can be easily opened and analyzed in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
The script also includes options for filtering the security groups based on specific criteria, such as the source IP address or port range. This allows you to easily identify and analyze specific security groups.

By automating the process of retrieving and organizing security group information, this script saves time and effort and makes it easier to ensure that your AWS environment is secure. Additionally, by exporting the results to a CSV file, you can easily share the information with other stakeholders and collaborate on security-related decisions.

In conclusion, if you're a solution architect working in AWS, managing security groups can be a challenge. However, by leveraging the power of Python and the AWS CLI, you can make this task much easier and more efficient. Whether you're auditing security groups, identifying potential security risks, or simply keeping track of your environment's security posture, this script can help you stay on top of your security needs.
